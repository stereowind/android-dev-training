    <string name="article_subtitle">Description of 80/20 rule called Pareto Principle</string>
    <string name="article_text">The <b>Pareto principle</b> (also known as the 80/20 rule, the law of the vital few, or the principle of factor sparsity) states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
Management consultant Joseph M. Juran suggested the principle and named it after Italian economist <i>Vilfredo Pareto</i>, who noted the 80/20 connection while at the University of Lausanne in 1896, as published in his first work, Cours d\'Ã©conomie politique.
Essentially, Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.
\nIt is an axiom of business management that \"80% of sales come from 20% of clients\".
Richard Koch authored the book, The 80/20 Principle, which illustrated some practical applications of the Pareto principle in business management and life.
\nMathematically the 80/20 rule is roughly followed by a power law distribution (also known as a <i>Pareto distribution</i>) for a particular set of parameters, and many natural phenomena have been shown empirically to exhibit such a distribution.
\nThe Pareto principle is only tangentially related to Pareto efficiency. Pareto developed both concepts in the context of the distribution of income and wealth among the population.
\n\nIn computer science the Pareto principle can be applied to optimization efforts.
For example, Microsoft noted that by fixing the top 20% of the most-reported bugs, 80% of the related errors and crashes in a given system would be eliminated.
\nLowell Arthur expressed that "20 percent of the code has 80 percent of the errors. Find them, fix them!"
It was also discovered that in general the 80% of a certain piece of software can be written in 20% of the total allocated time.
Conversely, the hardest 20% of the code takes 80% of the time. This factor is usually a part of COCOMO estimating for software coding.
